282. Notification by Roger, archbishop of York, Robert, dean, and
the chapter of St. Peter, of their grant to the hospital of St. Peter,
York, of the messuage which belonged to the prebend late of
Simon de Sigillo (to which John the archdeacon has succeeded),
and which adjoins the messuage of the dean of York, quit of all
pension to the church of St. Peter or the said prebend; in
exchange for the messuage which Thomas de Reinevill held of
the hospital and which brother Swane, proctor, and the brethren
of the hospital have granted to the church of St. Peter, quit of
all pension due to the hospital ; and, whereas the messuage of
the hospital is better provided with houses and garden than that
of the prebend, John the archdeacon has given to the hospital
30 marks. 1164-1175.
