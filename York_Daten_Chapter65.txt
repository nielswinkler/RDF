plain, belonging to the town of (Bishop) Thornton, lying between
Gill Moor and Felebrigg-beck and between the boundary of
Sawley and Haith-beck which divides (Bishop) Thornton from
Brimham, being to the north and west of Gill Moor; and in
Gill Moor a corner of wooded and open ground for a drift-way
for their flock, the place appearing to the monks to be too
narrow, whereby they were apprehensive as to thieves ; to hold
