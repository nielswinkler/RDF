150. Notification by Thurstan, archbishop of York, of his enactment
at the prayer, and with the assent, of the chapter that any
canon of York, upon changing his life and habit by becoming
a monk or canon regular, may at his departure bequeath two
parts of his prebend for a whole year to the church whither he
betakes himself, or to his kinsmen or other needy persons, or
may apply these 2 parts to the payment of his debts, the other
third part remaining for the year to St. Peter's for rebuilding
or other provision ; otherwise at a canon's death, having
changed neither life nor habit, the church of St. Peter shall
have his prebend for one whole year. The same to apply to
the churches of St. John of Beverley, St. Wilfrid of Ripon, St.
Mary of Southwell and St. Oswald of Gloucester. 1137-1140.
