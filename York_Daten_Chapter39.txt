39. Surrender by Gilbert, son of Nigel (of Huddleston), to the church
of St. Peter and to Roger, archbishop of York, his lord, of his
right in Clementhorpe in land and men, except the demesne
messuage, garden and meadow, which he has given to the nuns
of St. Clement, and except a bovate in Cawood of the fee of
St. Peter ; also of another bovate (in Cawood) of the fee of St.
Mary's (York), which his father received in exchange for
carucate in Poppleton of the fee of St. Peter ; which surrender
he made because he and his ancestors had usurped these
tenements, which belonged to the board of St. Peter's ; for
which he and they were now absolved ; but the service due
from him was not to be reduced on account of this surrender.
1165-1174.
