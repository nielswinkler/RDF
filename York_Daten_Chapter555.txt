Trinity, Hamon the treasurer, and Gregory canon of York to
do right in the complaint made by the canons of Nostell that
whereas Jueta de Arches had given some tithe of the bread of
her house to the canons dwelling at Skewkirk (in Tockwith),
which tithe William de Arches her father had given to the
canons of St. Oswald, she now withdrew it; also notification by
the said R., H. and G. that the lady Jueta has now granted a
moiety of the said tithe and the canons on their part undertake

of All Saints at Skewkirk for the souls of lady Jueta, her
parents, and her husbands, Adam de Brus and Roger de Flamvill.
