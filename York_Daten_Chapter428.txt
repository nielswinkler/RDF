428. Writ of Henry I to Osbert, sheriff (of York and Lincoln),
directing him that the churches of the demesne manors of
Aldborough, Pocklington, Great Driffield, Kilham and Pickering
shall not lose the parishes which belonged to them in the time
of king Edward by reason of the king's grant of soc(lands) to
certain of his barons, but each of those mother churches shall
have the chapels and tithes throughout those soc(lands), as
they belonged to his said manors in the time of king Edward.
