in Great Busby in the corner below the ford between Busby and
Dromonby, also in another corner near the garden of their
grange of Busby; confirmation also of land given by Eustace
son of Herbert and Ralph his nephew of the donor's fee in
Little Busby. These he gave because he proposed to betake
himself to Fountains when he took the habit of religion, and if
he died secular he bequeathed to the monks a third part of his
moiety of all his substance. 1180-1190.
